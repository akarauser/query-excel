Excel Query

This script utilizes Streamlit and Langchain to create an interactive interface for querying data from Excel files using the Ollama LLM. The script allows users to upload an Excel file and then ask questions about the data, with the LLM providing answers based on the uploaded data's contents. The code incorporates logging for debugging and error tracking, along with session management for maintaining conversation context within the Streamlit application. It relies on a configuration file for settings like the base model and local Ollama URL.
